  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a project coordinator for a technology company, living in Toronto, Canada. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I wanted to be able to better communicate with the technical professionals at work.</p>

<h4>My Mission</h4>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a project manager with social enterprise because I love to help others.</p>

<h4>My Experience</h4>
