 <strong>Site 1: The Fernway</strong><br />
 <a href="http://thefernway.com">http://thefernway.com/</a><br />
The Fernway is a travel information website to be launched. The website uses bold white elements cast against a milky dark purple background to create contrast. Upon landing on the website the bold white font is aligned to the left with the image of the woman centered. The boldness and size of the font draws the user's eyes to the left after seeing the woman. The combination of negative space from the background image is what draws the user's eyes to the text.</p>

 <p>The water ripples draw the user to content below the fold. The website continues the colour scheme, where the simple yet bold white elements against the plain purple background create contrast. By centering many of the larger page elements it creates visual balance on the page. All the images/videos used are large close-ups, this helps create the impact and focal point within each section.</p>

 <p>Within each section, font size instead of top-to-bottom ordering is used to convey hierarchy. Smaller font elements are less important than the larger font elements. This form of information presentation may not be immediately clear to the user. Although not as visually arresting, it might make more sense to order the elements in each section by importance.</p>

 <p><strong>Site 2: Electric Bodies</strong><br />
 <a href="http://www.electricbodies.com">http://www.electricbodies.com/</a><br />
Electric Bodies is a website that sells guitar body imprinted t-shirts. The website has a grey background framed by a solid white border and uses negative space to create focus. The presented content is balanced on-page by the use of space and size. The simple silhouettes, yet detailed body images, are evenly-spaced and presented in a grid. The difference of the guitar bodies to the background is striking. In contrast, by virtue of being only a few shades darker than the background, the website's title and menu blend into the background. The focus is clearly the guitar bodies.</p>

 <p>The website has an ongoing poll hidden in the website's menu. Through the use of hierarchy and guitar body image size, it is possible to incorporate the poll information on the home page.</p>

 <p><strong>Compare the two layouts.</strong><br />
How the two sites use size, space and balance are different but still effective. The flow on The Fernway jumps left to right as the user navigates vertically down the sections of the page in a single column layout. This is the result of the different focal elements scattered throughout each section on the page. The 3-column grid-style and minimal homepage content of Electric Bodies is more straight-forward, most of the content is accessible above the fold. Both websites use predominantly monochromatic schemes, the strategic use of colour then pops and draws the eyes towards the defined, now easy-to-find, focal points. </p>

 <p><strong>For thumbnails, what makes one solution more clear than another?</strong><br />
Clearly defined sections with the use of rectangles and squares is helpful in defining where the content will be placed in the space. Some thumbnails indicated text content using horizontal lines; this was helpful in showing how the text would flow across a section. Some thumbnails labelled their boxed elements, as an example Titles were immediately clear because they were labelled 'TITLE'. The use of different colours to denote different sections, menus, buttons or layers also clearly communicated the hierarchy of the page. </p>

 <p>A few details not immediately clear to a non-designer were simply crossed out squares, they were used to denote images. This became even more confusing when images overlapped or were oddly shaped. Some thumbnails sketched images within the crossed out squares, which made it clearer. Additionally, images with transparent sections were not readily apparent.</p>

Note how each of the thumbnail sketches demonstrate focal point, hierarchy and balance across different grid-based layouts.</p>
